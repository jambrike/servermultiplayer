# Cluero
A somewhat remake of that game cluedo, made up some of my own rules.

If you dont know what cluedo is its a murder mystery board game so very fitting for the midnight competition.

I need some extra hours to get hotel so this is what this is for in hack club, after to help make back money spent on flight tickets ill make an online multiplayer version which will be very fun challenge.

build/deploy instructions:

It is mostly written in javascript and obv some html,css.

You can fork the repository or download and then open the index.html file or host on a service such as netlify or cloudflare.

it is also available through the website cluero.pages.dev
